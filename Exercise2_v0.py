"""
Step 1:
Write a Python script that prompts the user for several numbers (when the user 
enter the string "stop", the script will stop prompting for numbers).
The numbers entered will be stored into a list one after the other.

while loop + input() function + int() or float() function + list append() or
insert() method


Step 2:
After having retrieved all the numbers, print the list.

print() function

Step 3:
The script will then compute and print the minimum, the maximum and the mean 
of the different numbers present in the list.

for or while loop + arithmetic operators
OR
predefine functions

Step 4:
Compute the "truncated mean" of the elements: 
the mean of all elements except the smallest and largest ones.

Example:
    if the list is:
    [3,4,3,6,77,3,77,55,45,45]
    
    the truncated mean will only take into account the elements:
    [4,6,55,45,45] (3 and 77 are ignored)
